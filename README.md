# Project 2 EEP 153
Team Wilbur Atwater

## Topic & Goals: 

Our project focused on analyzing the adult US Population and "extreme" minimum subsistence diets. We chose all canned, all frozen, all liquid,  all meat, and an all fresh food diets to compare. We chose these unique diets because under conditions of food scarcity or emergency situations, such as natural disasters or supply chain disruptions, where access to a full range of fresh foods is limited. By evaluating these extreme diet scenarios, we can better understand the nutritional trade-offs and potential health impacts of relying solely on canned, frozen, liquid, meat, or fresh food sources.

#### Our project goals included:

Find how the minimum subsistence diet for people following different extreme diets such as frozen food diet, all meat, all fresh food, all liquid diet, and all canned food diet. 

Create recipes for all of these extreme diets and compare the taste, nutritional value, price,  and feasibility of each diet.  

## Files:
- Project2.ipynb contains our deliverables and solution code
- rda.csv contains the reccomended daily allowance data for the US population
- Wilbur Atwater min_cost_data files contain the filtered data frames that we use to find our solutions. These data frames are derived from the database of foods called the FNDDS (Food and Nutrition Database for Dietary Studies). We filtered the data using google sheets. The prices csv contains the price for each recipe (from USDA purchase to plate data).
